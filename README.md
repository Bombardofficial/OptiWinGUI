### OptiWin: Advanced Windows System Optimisation Tool

**OptiWin** is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for optimising the performance, battery life and usability of Windows-based systems. It integrates a range of features to meet the needs of gamers, professionals and everyday technical or non-technical users seeking an enhanced computing experience. Below is an overview of the key features of **OptiWin** and instructions on how to get started.

### Key Features:

- Power Management: **OptiWin** allows users to seamlessly switch between different power plans based on user preference or system requirements. This feature ensures an optimal balance between performance and power consumption.

- Display Management: Users can adjust their display settings directly through **OptiWin**. This includes changing the refresh rate of monitors, which can result in smoother visuals for gaming and video playback, or more energy-efficient settings for everyday tasks.

- Process management: **OptiWin** provides tools to monitor and manage background processes. Users can identify and terminate processes that are unnecessarily consuming system resources, improving overall system responsiveness and efficiency.

- Brightness Control:  **OptiWin** allows direct adjustment of brightness levels on laptops, PCs with one or more external monitors. This feature is particularly useful for users working in varying lighting conditions, allowing them to maintain optimum visibility and reduce eye strain.

- Manual & automatic pages: **OptiWin** has two pages. In the Manual Page, the user has full control over all adjustments and optimisations. Automatic Page, on the other hand, allows **OptiWin** to make intelligent adjustments based on real-time system analysis and user-defined preferences.

### Getting started:

- Installation: Download the **OptiWin** package and extract the contents. Locate and run the **OptiWin** executable file to start the application. No complex setup is required. The tool is ready to use as soon as it is launched.

- Select a page: From the main interface, choose between Manual and Automatic pages. Manual allows you to explore the various features via the dashboard to customise your system settings. In Automatic, configure your preferences once and let **OptiWin** manage optimisations in the background.

- Configure Power Plans: Navigate to the Change Power Plan section to switch between power plans. **OptiWin provides an option for each usage scenario, such as gaming or power saving.

- Adjust display settings: Select your preferred refresh rate and brightness settings in the Display Management section. Changes can be applied immediately and reversed if necessary.

- Manage processes: Use Process Management to view active processes. You can sort by resource usage and terminate any process with a simple click, freeing up valuable system resources.
